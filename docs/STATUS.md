# Status at v0.1.3

What the app actually does today.

Written by walking the code, not the commit messages: every line below was
checked against the file it names. `docs/PLAN.md` tracks the milestones M0–M9;
this document covers what landed after them, in the round of fixes and
features that followed the first real test on Windows.

## Fixed

Twelve problems were found by using the app rather than by reading it. All
twelve are fixed.

| # | What was wrong | Where it was fixed |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Attachment images were never drawn. `ImageGrid` rendered an empty `div` with a generated gradient, and the filename survived only as a tooltip — so a photo arrived as a coloured rectangle. | `attachment_data_url` in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/conversations.rs`, capped by `MAX_INLINE_IMAGE_BYTES`. Rust still decrypts and verifies before anything is shown. |
| D2 | Links sat under the message as an attachment instead of being part of it. | `MessageList.tsx` renders the URL inside the text and hands it to `openUrl`, so it opens in the system browser and never inside the WebView. The context menu offers *Open link* and *Copy address*. |
| D3 | Link previews appeared not to work. | Nothing was broken: the machinery was already there and the setting is **off by default** (§4.5). Left as it was, deliberately — a preview is a request to a stranger's server, and that stays opt-in. |
| D4 | Every avatar in a conversation was generated from an id, so nobody's real picture ever appeared. | `ConversationAvatar.tsx` and `HandleAvatar.tsx` resolve the member's profile and pass a real `imageUrl` through to `Avatar`. |
| D5 | Images inside a profile did not load. | `ProfilePage.tsx` now routes them through `RemoteImage`, the same presigned-GET path the banner and avatar already used. |
| D6 | The profile's tabs mixed two ideas: selection was marked with an underline, but hovering filled a rounded box — a preview of a shape that never appeared. | `Tabs` in `components/ui/Controls.tsx` now uses one underline in three states, so hovering previews where the indicator will land. Keyboard focus gained an explicit ring, which the box had been standing in for. |
| D7 | The button beside the chats carried the sign-out icon but read *Leave this conversation* — and did nothing but open a dialog. Sign-out itself was buried in the profile. | The real sign-out moved to `IconRail.tsx`, visible from every page, red on hover. |
| D8 | Home had a button that toggled a search box which the page already showed. | Removed; the search field is simply always there. |
| D9 | The Appearance section always showed the moon, whichever theme was on. | Its icon is now derived from the active theme — the list entry carries a placeholder that the render replaces. |
| D10 | Auto-lock did not lock. Content disappeared, but the session stayed open — a security promise the app did not keep. | Locking now ends the session for real. Getting back in needs the PIN (see N11) or the password. |
| D11 | Confirmations and notices were operating-system dialogs that looked nothing like the app. | `DialogHost.tsx` and `Modal.tsx` replace them; `notify` and `confirm` route through the app's own surfaces. |
| D12 | Right-clicking anywhere produced the browser's menu. | Suppressed globally in `main.tsx`, with the app's own menu in its place (N7). |

Nothing from that round is outstanding.

## Built

Twelve features, in the order they matter to someone using the app.

### Messages

- **Full-size media viewer** — clicking an image or video opens it over the
  conversation. `features/messages/Lightbox.tsx`.
- **Media strip** — under the viewer, every image and video in the
  conversation, so you jump straight to one instead of scrolling back.
- **Jump to latest** — scrolling up reveals a button back to the bottom, and
  when messages arrive meanwhile it carries the count of what you missed.
  `MessageList.tsx`.
- **Composer in an empty conversation** sits with the invitation in the middle
  of the page and only moves to the bottom once there is history above it.
- **Full emoji set** with categories and search, replacing the eight that were
  hardcoded. `components/ui/EmojiPicker.tsx`.

### Throughout

- **The app's own context menu** on right-click, with entries that suit what
  was clicked — a message, an image, a link, a conversation.
  `components/ui/ContextMenu.tsx`.

### Profiles

- **Other people's profiles** can be opened, with the server deciding
  per field what a viewer may see (G2 — the client never picks).
  `features/profile/PublicProfile.tsx`.
- **Message someone from their profile**, which starts the conversation and
  goes straight to it.

### Security

- **PIN unlock.** After auto-lock, a PIN gets you back in instead of the full
  password. `crates/client/src/pin.rs`.

  What it does and does not buy, plainly: the PIN unwraps a stored copy of the
  store key, and that copy is itself bound to the Windows account through
  DPAPI. So an attacker needs the PIN *and* the signed-in Windows session — a
  four-digit code alone is roughly ten thousand guesses and would be no
  protection on its own. Attempts are limited, and the password remains the
  way back in. This deliberately trades a little of the stolen-laptop
  protection for a lock people will actually leave switched on;
  `docs/THREAT-MODEL.md` §3 is where that trade belongs.

### Appearance

- **Accent colour** as a hue rather than a free colour: saturation and
  lightness stay fixed so every accent still clears the 4.5:1 the design
  system asks for (§7.4). `preferences.accentHue`.
- **Background depth** — a slider from the designed palette to pure black in
  dark mode, pure white in light. Every surface moves proportionally, so
  panels stay distinguishable at the far end. `preferences.contrast`.
- **Blur strength** as a slider rather than a switch, where zero drops
  `backdrop-filter` entirely instead of setting it to zero — the property
  costs the GPU whatever its radius, which is why the switch existed
  (PLAN.md risk 9). `preferences.glassStrength`.
- **A translucent window.** The same switch asks Windows for an acrylic
  backdrop, so the desktop behind the app is genuinely visible through it,
  blurred by the window manager. CSS cannot do this on its own:
  `backdrop-filter` blurs what is behind an element *in the document*, and the
  wallpaper is not in the document. The window is created transparent and Rust
  asks DWM (`windows::set_backdrop`); the WebView only makes its own field
  translucent once that call reports the effect actually applied, because a
  transparent window without it is a hole through to the desktop rather than
  glass over it.
- **A draggable divider on Home**, between the feed and the most recent
  conversation. Replaces three fixed hairlines with one line that means
  something. `preferences.homeChatWidth`.
